I have made Dashboard for Devices Health Monitoring 

In this Dashboard Thare are multilpe Devices , Multile Location.
issue is there APAC region Devices have access to ping on our Server .
There is no problem regarding APAC Region .

But There are some Devices are network Restricted.
EMEA region - LT.Vilinus devices have diffrent network policy.
this device are not ping on our APAC server.
but they are ping on their Vilinus Server.

same issue for Moscow , Costa Rica Devices.

so can i do this 

We run 3 Script on Diffrent Server.

Like We ping APAC Devices on our APAC Server.

Ping Emea Devices on Vilinus Server.

First Store Both Server data on database- Which is combine for both

Both Server data Store ( Devices Status data ) are store in database.
Then Render data On UI froom dtabase.

is it posible.
