I have completed the project, including both the Device Dashboard and Device Trend Analysis. I have thoroughly tested the project from my end, and all functions are working as expected. The project meets all the required outputs as per our specifications.

I kindly request you to review the project details at your convenience during office hours and let me know if any changes are needed. Once you have reviewed it, we can discuss deploying the project on the server.

Looking forward to your feedback.
