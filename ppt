Slide 5: Technologies Used

This slide highlights the technologies and tools used to develop the Device Health Monitoring & Trend Analysis Dashboard, providing an overview of the tech stack behind the system.

Content for Slide 5:

Title: Technologies Used

Bullet Points:
	1.	Backend: Node.js – Manages server-side logic and API development.
	2.	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript – Builds the user interface for real-time monitoring.
	3.	Database: Currently using JSON for data storage; planning to migrate to SQL for better scalability and efficiency.
	4.	Networking: Ping Commands – Periodically checks device status to track uptime and downtime.
	5.	Visualization: Displays downtime trends in a structured table format for easy analysis.
	6.	Excel Integration: Assists users in generating health reports efficiently.

Would you like to add a timeline or roadmap for the SQL migration on a separate slide?



















Slide 4: System Workflow

This slide explains how the Device Health Monitoring & Trend Analysis Dashboard functions step by step.

Content for Slide 4:

Title: System Workflow

Bullet Points:
	1.	Step 1: Ping Devices – The system pings all devices at regular intervals to check their status.
	2.	Step 2: Monitor Uptime/Downtime – Tracks whether each device is online or offline.
	3.	Step 3: Record Data – Uptime and downtime data is collected and displayed on the UI.
	4.	Step 4: Display Data on UI – The system provides a real-time view of device health, helping users create daily health reports faster.
	5.	Step 5: Analyze Trends – Tracks long-term performance trends (daily, weekly, monthly) to identify recurring failures or downtime patterns.
	6.	Step 6: Flag Devices for Repair – Devices with frequent downtime are flagged for attention to reduce failures.
	7.	Continuous Improvement – We are actively enhancing each function to improve system accuracy and efficiency.

This version keeps the focus on UI-based monitoring and assisting in report generation rather than generating reports directly.

Device Health Monitoring & Trend Analysis Dashboard

The Device Health Monitoring & Trend Analysis Dashboard is an automated system designed to track the uptime and downtime of devices, generate daily health reports, and analyze long-term performance trends. It provides real-time status updates, trend insights, and repair recommendations, helping organizations proactively maintain device reliability and reduce downtime. The system ensures efficient monitoring through automated reporting, graphical analysis, and intelligent failure detection.






Great! You have the Title and Project Description on the first slide. Now, let’s move step by step.

Slide 2: Introduction

This slide should explain:
	1.	What is the purpose of the project?
	2.	Why was it developed?
	3.	What problem does it solve?

Content for Slide 2:

Title: Introduction
Bullet Points:
	•	Modern organizations rely on multiple devices for operations, requiring continuous monitoring.
	•	Manual tracking of device uptime/downtime is time-consuming and inefficient.
	•	This system automates real-time device health monitoring and provides insights for better maintenance.
	•	Helps in identifying failures early and assists in making accurate reports for trend analysis.
